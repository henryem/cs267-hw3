Note that the project currently builds only on Linux, because I cannot figure out how to build BUPC
or GUPC on OSX 10.10.

First, download and install Berkeley UPC (BUPC).  You will need to build from source.  Follow
the instructions here:

http://upc.lbl.gov/download/source.shtml#runtime

...for the Berkeley UPC runtime.
